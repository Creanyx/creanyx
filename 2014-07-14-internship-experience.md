## Internship at Creanyx
###Dania Zeb



I was selected as an intern at Creanyx Inc. and I have been working here for two weeks now. So far I have been super busy unlike my friends who are doing internships at other companies. I have learned a lot of new things related to my field of studies i.e. Computer Science like PHP Laravel, data migration etc. I couldn't have learned these things during the semester because of the standard course outline the university has to follow. The university only teaches you the basics but the actual work environment polishes your skills by teaching you the advanced skills and techniques.

I am not going to lie but getting a taste of the professional environment and working all day is not so amusing but the best part is you get to learn a lot and you get to appreciate the fathers and brothers who have to work their entire lives to earn a living for their families. It is not an easy task. Speaking of which, the employees here work non-stop like machines. They don't get theirs eyes off the computer screen at all. I mean after all everyone needs a break from work. But this shows their hard work, determination and dedication towards work which I think is what our nation needs right now. Because to achieve success you must work hard.
