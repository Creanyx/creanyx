## Interning at Creanyx
###Nida-I-Zamir


When I first applied at Creanyx, I didn’t expect even an interview call. But I did receive one, after a few hours. I went there of course, scared since I couldn’t get my CV printed and in short, had woken up on the wrong side of the bed. 

But as soon as I got talking to the interviewing panel, I felt at ease immediately. They were not going to cage me, and were more cooperative than I’d been expecting. I had been panicking about the CV but my parents told me if they liked me, they would accept me on the basis of my expertise, not a printed sheet of paper. And that is exactly what happened. They didn’t create a deal out of it and were flexible, asking if I had it in softcopy form.

So I joined after the weekend, and stepped into the world of countless learning experiences. It was JUST my first day and I had learnt about different APIs, practical use of technology, new languages and their uses, and before I knew it, I found myself reading technology blogs on my own, something that I haven’t really done before for more than half an hour.

The atmosphere of the cosy little office reeks of workaholics. Not in a negative way, though. It’s actually very intriguing. I haven’t seen any of the employees lose their nerves, though they work incessantly. It really opened my eyes working at Creanyx, to practical life and working while keeping my sanity intact. 

Even though most of my friends are interning at one place or the other, they all seem to have no work to do except Facebooking and watching America’s Next Top Model. However, at Creanyx, even internees are made to work on real time projects the employers are working on themselves, and we even get work on the weekends or after office hours. It might sound a little scary, but it’s NOT. What I’ve learnt in just a few weeks here is much more than what I’ve been learning academically. 

Although the workload is actually at a professional level, the interns are treated with respect, and even encouraged to suggest any activities that might lessen the monotony of work everyday. The break timings are flexible, you can roam around barefoot if you want, order tea 50 times - to sum up: nothing is forced upon us which gives off a homely vibe, facilitating our comfort here.

All in all, I consider myself lucky to have landed at Creanyx, which sort of makes me wish that any company that I join after graduating has a hardworking yet compromising atmosphere just like this one.
